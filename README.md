## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive machine learning workflow applied to automotive manufacturing and parts distribution data. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The insights generated are aimed at driving informed decision-making in operations and business strategies.

## Project Details

- **Domain:** Automotive Manufacturing & Parts Distribution  
- **Client:** A multi-billion dollar company (name confidential under NDA)  
- **Scope:** The analysis covers data preprocessing, in-depth exploratory data analysis, model building using advanced ML algorithms, and thorough performance evaluation.  
- **Objective:** To uncover actionable insights and predictive patterns to optimize operations and mitigate parts shortages.

## Iterative Approach & Lessons Learned

The project followed a highly iterative and experimental approach:

- **KNN Imputation:**  
  - **Goal:** To fill missing values.  
  - **Outcome:** Although conceptually sound, this approach was computationally intensive and ultimately dropped.
  
- **Decision Tree Analysis:**  
  - **Goal:** To understand relationships between key entities (PDCs and Desks) and evaluate baseline performance.  
  - **Outcome:** Revealed differences in performance across subsets and low recall in some categories.
  
- **Class Weighting in Decision Trees:**  
  - **Goal:** To improve recall by penalizing misclassifications.  
  - **Outcome:** Did not yield the desired improvements during training.
  
- **Clustering and Segmented Modeling:**  
  - **Goal:** To identify distinct subsets and apply tailored models (Decision Trees, Random Forests) for enhanced accuracy and precision.  
  - **Outcome:** Although promising, this approach did not produce significantly better results.
  
- **XGBoost Implementation:**  
  - **Goal:** To build a robust model with superior predictive performance.  
  - **Outcome:** Delivered improved results. A comprehensive hold-out analysis was performed across various scenarios (single/multiple Desks and PDCs, skewed subsets) to ensure metrics were robust and consistent.

These experiments not only refined the model selection process but also deepened the understanding of data nuances within a high-stakes, industrial context.
